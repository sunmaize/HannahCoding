Java is renowned for its stability, reliability, and ongoing commitment to improvements. One of the notable aspects of Java is its Long-Term Support (LTS) versions, which are maintained and updated for several years. This article will discuss the key features of the most recent LTS versions of Java: Java 8, Java 11, Java 17, and Java 21.

## What is an LTS Version?

An LTS version of Java is a release that receives long-term support from Oracle or other Java vendors. These versions are typically supported for a minimum of three years, making them ideal for enterprises and production systems that require stability and reliability. LTS versions also receive critical updates and bug fixes during their support cycle.

## Key Features of Java LTS Versions

### 1. Java 8 (Released in March 2014)

Java 8 introduced several groundbreaking features that transformed Java programming, making it more modern and functional.

- **Lambda Expressions:** Lambda expressions provide a clear and concise way to represent a single method interface using an expression. This allows for functional programming capabilities in Java.

  ```java
  List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
  names.forEach(name -> System.out.println(name));
  ```

- **Stream API:** The Stream API enables processing sequences of elements (such as collections) in a functional style, allowing for operations like filtering, mapping, and reduction.

  ```java
  List<String> filteredNames = names.stream()
      .filter(name -> name.startsWith("A"))
      .collect(Collectors.toList());
  ```

- **Default Methods:** Interfaces can now contain default methods with an implementation, enabling developers to add new functionality to interfaces without breaking existing implementations.

- **Date and Time API:** A new Date and Time API (java.time) was introduced to provide a more comprehensive and user-friendly approach to handling date and time.

### 2. Java 11 (Released in September 2018)

Java 11 is the second LTS release after Java 8, bringing further enhancements and new features.

- **New HTTP Client:** Java 11 introduced a new HTTP client API for making HTTP requests that supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations, along with WebSocket support.

  ```java
  HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();
  HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
      .uri(URI.create("https://example.com"))
      .build();
  HttpResponse<String> response = client.send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
  ```

- **Local-Variable Syntax for Lambda Parameters:** The `var` keyword can now be used in lambda expressions to infer the type of the parameters.

  ```java
  var names = List.of("Alice", "Bob");
  names.forEach((var name) -> System.out.println(name));
  ```

- **Removal of Java EE and CORBA Modules:** Java 11 removed several deprecated modules, including Java EE and CORBA, promoting a more streamlined Java.

- **String Methods:** New utility methods were added to the String class, such as `isBlank()`, `lines()`, and `strip()` for better string manipulation.

### 3. Java 17 (Released in September 2021)

Java 17 is the latest LTS version prior to Java 21, featuring numerous enhancements and a focus on performance and stability.

- **Sealed Classes:** Sealed classes and interfaces restrict which other classes can extend or implement them. This feature allows for better control over inheritance and type hierarchies.

  ```java
  sealed class Shape permits Circle, Rectangle {}
  ```

- **Pattern Matching for `instanceof`:** This feature simplifies the syntax of type checking and casting in a single operation, enhancing code readability.

  ```java
  if (obj instanceof String str) {
      System.out.println(str.toUpperCase());
  }
  ```

- **New macOS Rendering Pipeline:** Java 17 introduced a new rendering pipeline for macOS that improves the performance of Java applications on macOS.

- **Foreign Function & Memory API (Incubator):** This API allows Java programs to interact with native code and memory, providing a more efficient way to call non-Java libraries and manage memory outside of the Java heap.

- **Deprecations and Removals:** Java 17 has also deprecated and removed several outdated features and APIs, streamlining the language and enhancing performance.

### 4. Java 21 (Released in September 2023)

Java 21 continues the trend of innovation, adding several new features to enhance developer productivity and performance.

- **Record Patterns:** This feature allows for more concise and expressive pattern matching with records, making it easier to extract data from records in a type-safe manner.

  ```java
  record Point(int x, int y) {}

  if (obj instanceof Point(int x, int y)) {
      System.out.println("Point coordinates: " + x + ", " + y);
  }
  ```

- **Virtual Threads (Preview):** The introduction of virtual threads aims to simplify the development of concurrent applications. Virtual threads are lightweight threads that enable thousands of concurrent tasks with a simpler programming model.

- **Scoped Values (Incubator):** This feature allows developers to manage values that can be scoped to a specific context, facilitating better data sharing and context management in concurrent applications.

- **String Templates (Preview):** String templates introduce a new way to define and manipulate strings in a more readable and maintainable format, allowing for embedded expressions within strings.

- **Foreign Function & Memory API (Second Incubator):** Continued improvements to the Foreign Function & Memory API provide developers with enhanced capabilities for calling native code and managing memory outside the Java heap.

## Conclusion

The Long-Term Support (LTS) versions of Java play a crucial role in the Java ecosystem, offering stability and new features that enhance developer productivity. Each LTS version introduces significant improvements, making Java a continuously evolving language that meets modern programming needs. By embracing these LTS versions, developers can leverage the latest features while ensuring their applications remain robust and maintainable.

As you consider which version of Java to use for your projects, keep in mind the rich set of features offered in these LTS releases, and choose the one that best fits your application's needs.
