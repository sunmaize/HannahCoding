Java has gone through many changes since its inception, with regular updates introducing new features, performance improvements, and enhancements for developers. In this article, weâ€™ll look at the most significant new features from Java 8 to the latest version, Java 21, highlighting how these features improve the language and make it more efficient and developer-friendly.

## 1. Java 8 (March 2014)

Java 8 was a major release, introducing several groundbreaking features that shaped modern Java development.

### Key Features:

### 1.1 Lambdas and Functional Programming

Java 8 introduced **lambda expressions**, which allow for more concise code when working with functional interfaces (interfaces with a single abstract method).

```java
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
names.forEach(name -> System.out.println(name));
```

### 1.2 Streams API

The **Streams API** allows for functional-style operations on collections of data, such as filtering, mapping, and reducing.

```java
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
names.stream()
    .filter(name -> name.startsWith("A"))
    .forEach(System.out::println);
```

### 1.3 Default Methods in Interfaces

Interfaces can now include **default methods**, which provide implementations for methods directly in the interface.

```java
public interface Vehicle {
    default void start() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle is starting.");
    }
}
```

### 1.4 Optional Class

The **Optional** class was introduced to handle null values more gracefully, avoiding `NullPointerExceptions`.

```java
Optional<String> name = Optional.ofNullable(null);
name.ifPresent(System.out::println);  // Will not print anything
```

### 1.5 Date and Time API

Java 8 introduced a new **Date and Time API** (java.time package) to replace the outdated `Date` and `Calendar` classes.

```java
LocalDate date = LocalDate.now();
System.out.println(date);
```

## 2. Java 9 (September 2017)

Java 9 introduced a series of significant changes, including modularity and improvements to the JDK.

### Key Features:

### 2.1 Project Jigsaw (Module System)

The **Java Platform Module System** (JPMS) allows developers to modularize their applications, improving security, maintainability, and performance.

```java
module com.example.myapp {
    requires java.base;
}
```

### 2.2 JShell (Interactive REPL)

Java 9 introduced **JShell**, an interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) that allows developers to run Java code snippets without needing to write an entire class or method.

```shell
jshell> System.out.println("Hello, JShell!");
Hello, JShell!
```

### 2.3 Factory Methods for Collections

Java 9 added **factory methods** for creating immutable collections in a simpler way.

```java
List<String> names = List.of("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
```

---

## 3. Java 10 (March 2018)

Java 10 brought small but useful improvements to the language, focusing on developer productivity.

### Key Features:

### 3.1 Local Variable Type Inference (`var`)

The `var` keyword introduced **type inference** for local variables, allowing the compiler to infer the type based on the context.

```java
var names = List.of("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
```

This feature reduces boilerplate code and improves readability while maintaining type safety.

---

## 4. Java 11 (September 2018)

Java 11 is a Long-Term Support (LTS) release that brought several important improvements, especially for cloud-native and microservice development.

### Key Features:

### 4.1 HTTP Client API

The **new HTTP Client API** replaces the legacy `HttpURLConnection` class, providing a more modern and flexible way to send HTTP requests.

```java
HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();
HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
    .uri(URI.create("https://example.com"))
    .build();
client.sendAsync(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString())
      .thenApply(HttpResponse::body)
      .thenAccept(System.out::println);
```

### 4.2 New String Methods

Java 11 introduced helpful new methods for working with strings, such as `strip()`, `isBlank()`, and `lines()`.

```java
String text = " Hello World ";
System.out.println(text.strip());  // "Hello World"
System.out.println(text.isBlank());  // false
```

### 4.3 Running Java Files without `javac`

You can now run Java source files directly without compiling them manually with `javac`.

```bash
java HelloWorld.java
```

## 5. Java 12 (March 2019)

Java 12 continued to introduce smaller enhancements focused on improving language usability and performance.

### Key Features:

### 5.1 Switch Expressions (Preview)

Switch expressions simplify switch-case statements by returning values and eliminating fall-through behavior.

```java
String day = "MONDAY";
String result = switch (day) {
    case "MONDAY", "TUESDAY", "WEDNESDAY" -> "Weekday";
    case "THURSDAY", "FRIDAY" -> "Almost weekend";
    case "SATURDAY", "SUNDAY" -> "Weekend";
    default -> "Unknown";
};
```

---

## 6. Java 13 (September 2019)

Java 13 focused on refining existing features and providing new productivity tools.

### Key Features:

### 6.1 Text Blocks (Preview)

Text blocks allow you to write multi-line strings in a more readable and concise way.

```java
String json = """
    {
      "name": "Alice",
      "age": 25
    }
    """;
```

---

## 7. Java 14 (March 2020)

Java 14 continued to refine features introduced in earlier versions, with some exciting new additions.

### Key Features:

### 7.1 Pattern Matching for `instanceof` (Preview)

This feature simplifies type checks by eliminating the need for explicit casting after an `instanceof` check.

```java
if (obj instanceof String s) {
    System.out.println(s.length());
}
```

### 7.2 Records (Preview)

**Records** provide a simple way to declare classes that are primarily used to hold data.

```java
public record Person(String name, int age) {}
```

---

## 8. Java 15 (September 2020)

Java 15 introduced several refinements and made some preview features permanent.

### Key Features:

### 8.1 Sealed Classes (Preview)

**Sealed classes** restrict which classes can extend or implement them, providing better control over inheritance hierarchies.

```java
public abstract sealed class Shape
    permits Circle, Square, Rectangle {}
```

---

## 9. Java 16 (March 2021)

Java 16 added final touches to many features introduced earlier and enhanced the development experience.

### Key Features:

### 9.1 Records (Permanent)

Records became a permanent feature, offering concise data carriers without the boilerplate code.

### 9.2 Pattern Matching for `instanceof` (Permanent)

The pattern matching feature for `instanceof` is now officially part of the language.

---

## 10. Java 17 (September 2021)

Java 17 is another Long-Term Support (LTS) release, with several major enhancements.

### Key Features:

### 10.1 Sealed Classes (Permanent)

Sealed classes became a permanent feature, providing better control over class hierarchies.

### 10.2 Pattern Matching for Switch (Preview)

Switch expressions now support pattern matching, further simplifying code involving conditional logic.

```java
Object obj = "Hello";
switch (obj) {
    case String s -> System.out.println(s.length());
    case Integer i -> System.out.println(i + 10);
    default -> System.out.println("Unknown type");
}
```

---

## 11. Java 21 (September 2023)

Java 21 is the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) release, introducing exciting new features aimed at enhancing developer experience and performance.

### Key Features:

### 11.1 Record Patterns (Preview)

Record patterns allow you to destructure records directly in patterns, making it easier to access fields without manual extraction.

```java
record Person(String name, int age) {}

void printPerson(Person person) {
    switch (person) {
        case Person(String name, int age) -> 
            System.out.println("Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age);
    }
}
```

### 11.2 Virtual Threads (Preview)

Virtual threads simplify multithreading in Java, allowing you to create lightweight threads that are managed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) rather than the operating system.

```java
Thread.ofVirtual().start(() -> {
    // Your task here
});
```

### 11.3 Scoped Values (Preview)

Scoped values provide a way to store data that is automatically scoped to a specific context, allowing for better control over data visibility.

```java
ScopedValue<String> value = ScopedValue.newValue();
```

### 11.4 Enhanced Switch Patterns (Preview)

This feature extends switch statements to include the ability to match on types and destructure complex data structures, making code more concise and readable.

```java
switch (object) {
    case String s -> System.out.println("It's a string: " + s);
    case Integer i -> System.out.println("It's an integer: " + i

);
    // Other cases...
}
```
